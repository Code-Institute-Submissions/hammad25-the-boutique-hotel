## Project Overview
In this project I have created a hotel bookings management system that links to a spreadsheet. The user operating the system can create a booking by entering inputs of the client for whom the booking is made. The system ensures correct data is entered within each input by rasising an error if incorrect data or format is entered. The system also generates a total cost to stay at the hotel based on the type of room selected, the number of nights and people. Finallythe system than generates a booking ID for each client and adds it to the spreadsheet. The user can also fetch all bookings to be displayed altogether or display each booking by entering a specific booking ID.
